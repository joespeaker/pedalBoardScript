# pedalBoardScript
 This script is used to automate audio editing for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCViayCohw-MFBtMmqIzHQGg">YouTube channel.</a>

 This project uses Spotify's open source project called <a href="https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard">pedalboard</a> to add reverb to the audio.
